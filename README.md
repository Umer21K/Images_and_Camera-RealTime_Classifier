# Images_and_Camera-RealTime_Classifier : An AI-powered Solution for Object Identification

## Introduction(Aim):
-The goal of the Image and Camera Classifier Application is to provide a tool that is easy to use
for precisely detecting items in photos and live video streams that are taken with laptop cameras.
Inspired by the growing need for sophisticated picture identification systems across a range of
industries, including retail, healthcare, and surveillance, this project aims to offer a solution that
leverages machine learning techniques.

## Project Specification:
### There are two main features that the Image and Camera Classifier Application is intended to
provide:
- Image Classifier: When users input photographs to the program, it uses TensorFlow to
create a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect objects in the
images.
- Camera Classifier: Using a classifier model trained with scikit-learn on user-defined
datasets, users may use the cameras on their laptops to record live video streams. The
program will analyse each frame in real-time and identify items.

## Solution Design(Project Details, Functionality and Features)
### The components that make up the Image and Camera Classifier Application are as follows:
-Picture Classifier: Trains a CNN model on a preprocessed dataset for object recognition
in uploaded photos using TensorFlow.
-Camera Classifier: This tool uses scikit-learn to build a classifier model on user-defined
datasets so that laptop camera streams may be used for real-time item recognition.
-GUI Interface: Made with Tkinter, it offers consumers an easy-to-use platform for
uploading photos and viewing camera categorization in real time.
-Preprocessing and Post-processing Modules: Use preprocessing methods for images to
improve the accuracy of classification, and post-processing modules to show the user the
findings.
